      <p>Resource Monitor is a Windows desktop application that displays system hardware information such as CPU load, CPU frequency,
         memory load, and disk load in a transparent, HUD-like, always-on-top overlay. This allows
         hardware to be monitored without the use of a separate window such as Task Manager's performance tab.</p>

      <p>The overlay can be toggled on and off through a hotkey and is customizable. Individual counters
         can be moved around and their font, font color, font size, and background can be changed.
         Resource Monitor can also be launched on Windows startup and will preserve its state across uses.</p>

      <h2>Win32 Sadness</h2>
      <p>The first step in learning anything new consists of writing a simple 'hello world' program.
         These usually take up a few lines, are easy to understand, and provide a great starting point.
         Charles Petzold, author of Programming Windows, writes: "The original hello world program
         in the Windows 1.0 SDK was a bit of a scandal. HELLO.C was about 150 lines long, and the HELLO.RC
         resource script had another 20 or so more lines... Veteran programmers often curled up in horror or
         laughter when encountering the Windows hello-world program."</p>
      <p>So the Win API learning curve is quite steep, but developers are rewarded with access to low-level
         operations that allow their applications to have more flexibility and power.
         Back when Win API was first being developed, Microsoft had to support various CPU architectures and compilers.
         There were differences in 16 bit and 32 bit processors. There were differences in pre-ANSI C and unstandardized C++ compilers.
         There were differences in Intel, PowerPC, and ARM chips. Microsoft had to move from single-core to multi-core
         systems, deal with segmented memory, and support international encoding before Unicode existed.
         All of this results in many, Win32-specific custom types that seek to standardize development.</p>
      <p>For example, a data type of name <code>BOOL</code> exists. This is not to be confused with the traditional C++ <code>bool</code>,
         which is a boolean variable that takes either <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>. Rather <code>BOOL</code> is an int that takes or returns
         values <code>TRUE</code> and <code>FALSE</code> which are not booleans but ints as well. This results in functions as such as
         <code>BOOL CALLBACK EditDlgProc(HWND hwndDlg, UINT message, WPARAM wParam, LPARAM lParam);</code> which at first glance
         seems to return a true or false depending on whether or not it succeeds but in actuality returns the int 1, 0,
         or a numeric error code. If you're like me and wondering why this isn't written as
         <code>int CALLBACK EditDlgProc(HWND hwndDlg, UINT message, WPARAM wParam, LPARAM lParam);</code>, it's because it was
         once considered good practice to use abstract types rather than primitive types such as int, bool, and char.</p>
      <p>Here's another example. Word. I know what a word is. You know what a word is. A word is a collection of letters.
         So when Win32 documentation lists something like <code>DWORD</code>, I was absolutely floored to find out that DWORD is actually
         an <code>unsigned long int</code>. So instead of passing in a word into DWORD, I would be passing in numbers. Unsurprisingly, <code>WORD</code>
         is an <code>unsigned short int</code>. This leads to functions like <br><code>HFONT CreateFontA(<br>
            int    cHeight,<br>
            int    cWidth,<br>
            int    cEscapement,<br>
            int    cOrientation,<br>
            int    cWeight,<br>
            DWORD  bItalic,<br>
            DWORD  bUnderline,<br>
            DWORD  bStrikeOut,<br>
            DWORD  iCharSet,<br>
            DWORD  iOutPrecision,<br>
            DWORD  iClipPrecision,<br>
            DWORD  iQuality,<br>
            DWORD  iPitchAndFamily,<br>
            LPCSTR pszFaceName<br>
            );</code><br>
         where the unassuming programmer might think the parameter
         <code>DWORD  bItalic</code> would take some type of word that describes the italic setting. Maybe something like 'italic' or 'normal'.
         You would actually pass in <code>TRUE</code> which represents the numeric value 1 and can be stored as an int. Confusingly,
         there are also regular int parameters that CreateFontA takes along with its DWORD parameters that are not words, but ints.<p>
