      <h2>How Websites Work</h2>
      <p>When you’re browsing the web, you’re essentially fetching data from a server
         and viewing it on your local machine. To do so, a connection must be established
         between your machine and the site you are trying to reach. Every device connected to a
         network has a numerical label assigned to it known as an IP address and these are essential
         in making connections.</p>
      <p>Thus, the first step of visiting any website is translating the domain name
         into the site’s proper IP address. Google.com becomes 172.217.6.174,
         wikipedia.org becomes 208.80.153.224, and whuynh.me becomes 34.107.207.163.
         For demonstration’s sake, copy and paste 172.217.6.174 into your browser and
         see where it leads you. It should be noted that accessing websites through their
         IP addresses will not always work as some addresses host several websites.
         In addition, SSL is tied to domain names, not IP addresses so you might
         get a bunch of security alerts if you try to access a site through its
         IP address. The system that performs this translation is known as DNS
         (Domain Name System) but if you visit a site frequently enough, its IP
         address would be stored in cache.</p>
      <p>Now that we know the address of the site we’re trying to get to, we
         establish a connection with it. If you’re interested, you can dive into
         TCP and TLS to find out how this connection is kept secure. For the purposes
         of building a website all we need to know is that your browser sends a
         request (oftentimes a GET request) to ask the server to send over the
         website data. The server sends the appropriate files, and your browser
         transforms the files into a viewable website.</p>
      <h2>What Do I Have To Pay For?</h2>
      <p>You’ll have to pay for a domain name because nobody wants to access a
         site using its multi-digit long IP address. Unless you’re vying for a
         contested word, these are pretty inexpensive. For context, the domain
         name for this site costs less than $5 per year.</p>
      <p>You’ll also have to pay for a service to store your site’s files as well
         as run any backend code. This will be the server that visitors will
         connect to when accessing your site. Most hosting services offer shared
         hosting, VPS hosting, and dedicated hosting. The former of these options
         is cheapest, and the latter of these options can handle the largest load
         but is more expensive.</p>
      <p>If your site is completely client-based, then another option would be to
         use cloud storage. Static sites do not require server compute power and
         thus are cheaper to host. Most blogs, marketing websites, and this site
         operate as static sites. If you intend to do stuff like collect visitor
         data, send and receive cookies, or generate dynamic page content, then
         you’ll have to invest in a traditional hosting service.</p>
      <h2>Writing The Code</h2>
      <p>The traditional method of creating a site involves learning the necessary
         HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP and building it up from scratch. This is
         a great exercise for the build-it-yourself type and there is a plethora
         of free resources that will guide you through web-based languages. </p>
      <p>If you aren’t interested in doing that of if you don’t have the time to
         invest, you could use WordPress, a content management system that allows
         you to drag and drop webpage elements. WordPress allows you to create a
         fully functional site with zero programming knowledge.</p>
